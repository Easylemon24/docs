## What's new?

- **New admin panel**: We've revamped the entire admin panel to make it more admin-friendly and easier to use.
- **Better extension support**: We've added a lot of new features for extensions, such as the ability to create admin pages, hooks, and more. (See [Extensions](/docs/development/extensions/index) for more information)
- **In-app payments**: Gateway extensions are now able to show a payment form in the app itself. (We've already implemented this for Stripe!)
- **Multi currency**: Paymenter now also supports multiple currencies.
- **Unique billing periods**: You can now set unique billing periods for each product, you're not limited to the default (monthly, yearly, etc.) billing periods.
- And much more! Go check it out yourself!
